/**
 * A factory for [Workflow]s implemented as state machines that:
 *
 *  - move through states of `S`
 *  - accept events of type `E`
 *  - emit a result value of type `O` when completed
 *
 * When a new workflow is created with [discreteStateWorkflow], each consecutive state will be
 * passed to this function, along with a [ReceiveChannel] that can be used to accept events,
 * and a [WorkflowPool] that can be used to delegate work to nested workflows.
 *
 * This is a suspend function that eventually returns a [Reaction] indicating what to do next,
 * one of:
 *
 *   - [EnterState]: Emit [EnterState.state] from from channels previously opened by
 *   [Workflow.state][Workflow.openSubscriptionToState], and pass it as the next state value of a
 *   new call to this function.
 *
 *   - [FinishWith]: Deliver the result value to callers of [Workflow.await], and terminate
 *   the workflow.
 *
 * To handle events received from [Workflow.sendEvent], just receive from the channel from within
 * your function:
 *
 *    suspend fun nextState(
 *      state: MyState,
 *      events: ReceiveChannel<MyEvent>,
 *      workflows: WorkflowPool
 *    ): Reaction<MyState, MyResult> {
 *      return when(state) {
 *        FooOrDone -> when(val event = events.receive()) {
 *          Foo -> handleFoo()
 *          Done -> FinishWith(it.result)
 *          else -> throw IllegalStateException("Invalid event: $event")
 *        }
 *
 *        FooOrBarState -> when(val event = events.receive()) {
 *          Foo -> handleFoo()
 *          Bar -> EnterState(FooOrDone)
 *          else -> throw IllegalStateException("Invalid event: $event")
 *        }
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * This function is not limited to using the given [ReceiveChannel] to calculate its
 * next state. For example, a service call might be handled this way, mapping
 * a [Deferred][kotlinx.coroutines.experimental.Deferred] generated by Retrofit to the
 * appropriate [Reaction].
 *
 *    suspend fun nextState(
 *      state: MyState,
 *      events: ReceiveChannel<MyEvent>,
 *      workflows: WorkflowPool
 *    ): Reaction<MyState, MyResult> {
 *      return when(state) {
 *        WaitingForStatusResponse -> statusService.update().await().let { response ->
 *          if (response.success) EnterState(ShowingStatus(response))
 *          else EnterState(ShowingFailure(response)
 *        }
 *
 *      // ...
 *    }
 *
 * If you need to mix such command-like `Deferred`s with workflow events, use
 * [select][kotlinx.coroutines.experimental.selects.select]:
 *
 *    suspend fun nextState(
 *      state: MyState,
 *      events: ReceiveChannel<MyEvent>,
 *      workflows: WorkflowPool
 *    ): Reaction<MyState, MyResult> {
 *      return when(state) {
 *        WaitingForStatusResponse -> select {
 *
 *          statusService.update().onAwait { response ->
 *            if (response.success) EnterState(ShowingStatus(response))
 *            else EnterState(ShowingFailure(response)
 *          }
 *
 *          events.onReceive { event ->
 *            when(event) {
 *              Cancel -> EnterState(ShowingFailure(Canceled())
 *              else -> throw IllegalStateException("Invalid event: $event")
 *            }
 *          }
 *        }

 *      // ...
 *    }
 *
 * To define a state that delegates to a nested workflow, have the `S` subtype that
 * represents it implement [Delegating]. Use [WorkflowPool.awaitWorkflowUpdate]
 * when entering that state to drive the nested workflow and react to its result.
 *
 * For example, in the simplest case, where the parent workflow accepts no events
 * of its own while the delegate is running, the delegating state type would look
 * like this:
 *
 *     data class RunningNested(
 *       // Stores the state of the nested workflow, and used as its initial
 *       // state when it is started.
 *       override val delegateState: NestedState = NestedState.start()
 *     ) : MyState(), Delegating<NestedState, NestedEvent, NestedResult> {
 *       override val id = NestedReactor::class.makeWorkflowId()
 *     }
 *
 * You'd register a `NestedReactor` instance with the [WorkflowPool] passed
 * to your [launch][WorkflowPool.Launcher] implementation:
 *
 *    class MyLauncher(
 *      private val nestedReactor : NestedReactor
 *    ) {
 *      override fun launch(
 *        initialState: MyState,
 *        workflows: WorkflowPool
 *      ) : Workflow<MyState, MyEvent, MyResult> {
 *        workflows.register(nestedReactor)
 *        return workflows.discreetStateWorkflow(initialState, workflows, ::nextState)
 *      }
 *
 * and in your `nextState` function, use [WorkflowPool.workflowUpdate]
 * to wait for the nested workflow to do its job:
 *
 *    is Delegating -> workflows.awaitNextDelegateReaction(state).let {
 *      when (it) {
 *        is EnterState -> EnterState(state.copy(delegateState = it.state))
 *        is FinishWith -> when (it.result) {
 *          is DoSomething -> EnterState(DoingSomething)
 *          is DoSomethingElse -> EnterState(DoingSomethingElse)
 *        }
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * If you need to handle other events while the workflow is running, use the events channel and
 * `select` again.
 * Remember to call [WorkflowPool.abandonWorkflow] if you leave while the nested workflow is still
 * running!
 *
 *    is Delegating -> select {
 *      workflows.nextDelegateReaction(state).onAwait {
 *        when (it) {
 *          is EnterState -> EnterState(state.copy(delegateState = it.state))
 *          if FinishWith -> when (it.result) {
 *            is DoSomething -> EnterState(DoingSomething)
 *            is DoSomethingElse -> EnterState(DoingSomethingElse)
 *          }
 *        }
 *      }
 *
 *      events.onReceive { event ->
 *        when(event) {
 *          Cancel -> {
 *            workflows.abandonDelegate(state.id)
 *            EnterState(NeverMind)
 *          }
 *          else -> throw IllegalStateException("Invalid event: $event")
 *        }
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * To accept events for nested workflows, e.g. to drive a UI, define
 * [com.squareup.workflow.Renderer]s for both `S` and each of its [Delegating] subtypes.
 * [WorkflowPool.input] can be used by renderers to route events to any running workflow.
 *
 * @param S State type
 * @param E Event type. If your Reactor doesn't have any events, use `Nothing`
 * @param O Output (result) type
 * @see discreteStateWorkflow

/**
 * Implements a [Workflow] using a [StateTransitionFunction].
 * Use this to implement [WorkflowPool.Launcher.launch].
 *
 * The react loop runs inside a [workflow coroutine][workflow].
 *
 * The [initial state][initialState], and then each [subsequent state][EnterState], are all sent
 * to the builder's state channel.
 *
 * _Note:_
 * If the state transition function immediately returns [FinishWith], the last state may not be
 * emitted since the [state channel][Workflow.openSubscriptionToState] is closed immediately.
 *
 * ## Naming
 *
 * To help with debugging, pass a [CoroutineName] context element in [context]. This name will
 * be used in exceptions thrown from the workflow. Additionally, if coroutine debugging is enabled,
 * the name will show up in stack traces and thread names.
 *
 * ## Dispatchers
 *
 * If [context] contains a
 * [CoroutineDispatcher][kotlinx.coroutines.experimental.CoroutineDispatcher], it is not used.
 * The state transition function is always invoked from the [Unconfined] dispatcher. If your
 * function actually requires a particular dispatcher, it should use
 * [withContext][kotlinx.coroutines.experimental.withContext].
